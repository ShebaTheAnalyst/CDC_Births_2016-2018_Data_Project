CDC Births Data Query in BigQuery
In this query I used the CDC Births Data Summary public dataset. The queries I wrote helped me obtain some answers about which counties in the United States have the most and least births in the years 2016-2018.

SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_cdc_wonder_natality.county_natality` 
LIMIT 
  1000

Using the ORDER BY function, I sorted the data by Births.
SELECT 
  *
FROM 
  `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_cdc_wonder_natality.county_natality` 
ORDER BY
  Births
LIMIT 
  10

I filtered the query by using the ASC function but it didnâ€™t change.
SELECT 
  *
FROM 
  `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_cdc_wonder_natality.county_natality` 
ORDER BY
  Births
ASC
LIMIT 
  10

So, by filtering the data in descending order using the DESC function, I was able to see the top 10 counties with the highest yearly birth counts between 2016 and 2018.
SELECT 
  *
FROM 
  `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_cdc_wonder_natality.county_natality` 
ORDER BY
  Births
DESC
LIMIT 
  10

Next, I modified the query to show the top 10 counties with the highest birth counts for 2018.
SELECT 
  *
FROM 
  `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_cdc_wonder_natality.county_natality` 
WHERE 
  Year = '2018-01-01'
ORDER BY
  Births
DESC
LIMIT 
  10
